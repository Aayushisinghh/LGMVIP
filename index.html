            <h3>The Cosmos Society </h3>
            <p>
                The Society is dedicated to the exploration of the Solar System, the search for near-Earth objects, and the 
                search for extraterrestrial life. The society's mission is stated as: "To empower the world's citizens to 
                advance space science and exploration". The Planetary Society is also a strong advocate for space funding 
                and missions of exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Cosmos Society is currently governed by a 2-member volunteer board of directors chosen for their 
                passion about and knowledge of space exploration.

                <h2>Rick Sanchez</h2>
                <h4>Age	70, Chaotic Neutral</h4>
                <p>
                    Rick Sanchez (January 26th, 1951) is a member of The Smith household, being Beth Smith's father. He often goes on many adventures with his grandson Morty, and occasionally his granddaughter Summer. He has had a constant rivalry with Morty's father Jerry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not much is known about Rick's background, but it was revealed that he was absent from his family for 20 years. He has an extremely pessimistic worldview, stating that love is a chemical reaction and that Morty should skip marriage altogether and focus on science.
                </p>

                <h2>Morty Smith</h2>
                <h4>Age	14, Lawful Neutral</h4>
                <p>
                    Morty Smith (September 19th, 2002) is a fourteen year old boy and son of Jerry Smith and Beth Smith. He frequently goes on adventures with his grandpa Rick and occasionally his sister Summer. Morty is a good-hearted, well-mannered kid, although he isn't always the smartest. Despite this, he occasionally shows moments of intellect. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Morty tends to be the opposite of his grandpa. While Rick is rude, self-centered, and a genius, Morty is kind, caring, and somewhat of a dummy. This makes him a perfect sidekick for Rick, as his "Morty waves" cancel out Rick's and makes him undetectable.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Rick and Morty both currently live in a different dimension than the one they originated in, after Rick turned everyone into Cronenbergs.
